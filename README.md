The Warm Night theme translates the ambiance of a cozy campfire at sundown into a theme that's easier on the eyes late at night.

The palette aims to meet WCAG AA for contrast, but if you have trouble seeing something let me know and I'll try to improve it.

## Development
1. Perform all edits in *source-color-theme.json*
2. Run `npm run replace` to update *themes/warm-night.json* from source
3. Inside of *themes/warm-night.json*, Use VS Code's find and replace with `//.*\n\s*` regex to remove all comments
